# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression
This is one of the Kaggle Competitions. Data scientist/data science students are tasked to use 79 explanatory variables which describes (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, to predict the final price of each home. 

Steps I took:

I.	Conducted data Cleaning including imputing missing values

II.	Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify extreme values

III. Developed regression models using R

IV. Applied LASSO Regularization to identify the optimized number of explanatory variables
